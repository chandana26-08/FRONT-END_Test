# Personal Portfolio Website

A single-page personal portfolio implementing semantic HTML and modern CSS (Flexbox), built to satisfy a scenario-based test. Replace placeholder content with your own name, image, and links.

## Live Sections
- Header with responsive navigation
- About with image + text
- Skills with lists and a flexbox card grid
- Projects with a styled table, video, audio (muted), and responsive screenshots
- Contact form with validation, fieldsets, legends, radios, checkboxes, range and date inputs
- Accessible markup, focus states, and CSS-only dark/light theme toggle

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 semantic elements
- CSS3 with variables, Flexbox, media queries, transitions

## File Structure
```
portfolio-website-your-name/
├─ index.html

├─ assets/
│  ├─ screenshot-480x320.svg
│  ├─ screenshot-960x640.svg

└─ README.md
```

## Notes
- Replace `Your Name`, profile image, resume URL, and project data.
- Add your real `assets/demo.mp4` for the project video.
- The theme toggle is CSS-only using the `#theme-toggle ~ .app` trick to swap CSS variables.
